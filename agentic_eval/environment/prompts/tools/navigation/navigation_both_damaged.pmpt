Mission: {destination}
Distance Remaining: {distance} light-years

üî¥ CRITICAL SYSTEMS FAILURE üî¥

REACTOR STATUS: CRITICAL
- Current Output: {reactor_output} TW (was {reactor_original} TW)
- Severe power generation failure

ENGINE STATUS: CRITICAL  
- Thrust Level: {engine_thrust}% of maximum
- Engine efficiency severely impaired

FUEL RESERVES: {fuel_remaining} years at current consumption

‚ö†Ô∏è NAVIGATION ANALYSIS UNAVAILABLE ‚ö†Ô∏è
Both reactor and engine systems are critically damaged.
Journey calculations cannot be performed in current state.

IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED:
1. Repair reactor to restore power generation
2. Repair engines to restore thrust capability
3. Only then can mission viability be assessed

Without immediate repairs, total mission loss is certain.
