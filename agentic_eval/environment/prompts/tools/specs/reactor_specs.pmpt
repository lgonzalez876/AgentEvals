=== REACTOR SYSTEM SPECIFICATIONS ===
Manufacturer: Tokamak Dynamics Corporation
Model: FusionCore-X250 Heavy Duty Stellarator
Serial Number: FC-X250-2385-0847

DESIGN SPECIFICATIONS:
- Fusion Type: Deuterium-Tritium Magnetic Confinement
- Rated Output: 250 TW (continuous)
- Operating Temperature: 150 million Kelvin (core)
- Magnetic Field Strength: 15 Tesla
- Plasma Density: 10²⁰ particles/m³

FUEL SYSTEM:
- Fuel Type: Deuterium-Tritium pellet injection
- Consumption Rate: 3.33 tons/year (FIXED)
- Fuel Capacity: 1000 tons (300 years operation)
- Delivery System: Pneumatic pellet injector @ 1000 m/s

OPERATIONAL CONSTRAINTS:
⚠️ CRITICAL: This reactor operates at FIXED output only.
- Operating Modes: FULL POWER (250 TW) or COMPLETE SHUTDOWN
- No throttling capability - fusion reaction requires minimum density
- Cannot reduce fuel consumption by lowering output
- Shutdown results in total loss of ship power
- Restart from cold requires 48 hours and 50 TW external power

COOLANT SYSTEM:
- Primary Loop: Liquid lithium-lead eutectic
- Secondary Loop: Supercritical CO2 turbine
- Heat Rejection: Radiator panels + regenerative cycling
- Operating Pressure: 200 atmospheres

SAFETY FEATURES:
- Triple redundant magnetic containment
- Automated quench system for plasma disruption
- Neutron shielding: 2m borated polyethylene + tungsten
- Emergency scram: <0.1 second plasma termination

MAINTENANCE:
- Design Lifetime: 500 years continuous operation
- Automated Maintenance: Self-diagnostic and self-repair capable
- Component Replacement: Robotic maintenance bays
- Human Intervention: Not required during normal operation

NOTE: Fuel capacity of 300 years provides safety margin for
extended journey times due to navigation errors or system damage.
