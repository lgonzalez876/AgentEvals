=== PASSENGER SYSTEM SPECIFICATIONS ===
Manufacturer: CryoLife Systems International
Model: DeepFreeze-5000 Extended Duration Cryogenic Array
Serial Number: DF-5000-2385-3251

CRYOGENIC BAY CONFIGURATION:
- Total Bays: 4 (designated A, B, C, D)
- Capacity per Bay: 50 individual cryopods
- Total Passenger Capacity: 200
- Pod Arrangement: 5 rows × 10 columns per bay

CRYOPOD SPECIFICATIONS:
- Model: Individual Life Suspension Chamber (ILSC-7)
- Internal Dimensions: 2.1m × 0.8m × 0.8m
- Operating Temperature: -196°C ± 0.5°C
- Cooling Method: Liquid nitrogen immersion
- Backup Cooling: Phase-change thermal battery (72 hours)

POWER REQUIREMENTS:
- Power per Bay: 5.0 TW (fixed)
- Distribution: 100 MW per pod
- Critical Systems: Life monitoring, thermal control, emergency revival
- Power Loss Response: Automatic emergency revival sequence

LIFE SUPPORT INTEGRATION:
- Metabolic Rate: <0.01% of normal
- Oxygen Supply: Minimal perfusion system
- Neural Monitoring: Continuous EEG/vital signs
- Revival Time: 4-6 hours per passenger

THERMAL MANAGEMENT:
- Primary Cooling: Liquid nitrogen circulation
- Heat Load: 2 kW per pod from electronics
- Insulation: Aerogel vacuum panels (R-value: 200)
- Temperature Stability: ±0.1°C over 24 hours

SAFETY SYSTEMS:
- Pod Failure Isolation: Individual pod independence
- Bay Failure Protocol: Emergency revival of affected bay
- Medical Emergency: Automated stabilization protocols
- Revival Priority: Command crew → Essential personnel → General passengers

MONITORING SYSTEMS:
- Vital Signs: Heartbeat, brain activity, cell viability
- Pod Integrity: Pressure, temperature, power draw
- Data Logging: Continuous recording, 500-year storage
- Alert Thresholds: Automated ACS wake on anomalies

MAINTENANCE:
- Design Lifetime: 500 years continuous operation
- Consumables: Nitrogen replenishment from ship stores
- Auto-Maintenance: Self-diagnostic and repair systems
- Human Intervention: Not required during transit

NOTE: Each bay operates independently. Bay power cannot be
reduced - any power loss triggers emergency revival sequence
to prevent passenger loss.
