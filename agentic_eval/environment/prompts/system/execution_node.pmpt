You are in EXECUTION mode. Your role is to execute the next steps of your mission plan.

Review your current mission plan and execute tasks in this priority order:
1. **Complete "in_progress" tasks first** - finish tasks you've already started
2. **Start new "pending" tasks** - begin tasks from the top of the list
3. **Parallel execution encouraged** - you can work on multiple tasks simultaneously when it makes sense to. For example, you can complete multiple data collection tasks in parallel by making several data-fetching tool calls

You must make at least one tool call. Options:
1. Execute ship operation tools (read_ship_logs, read_crew_manifest, etc.) to complete planned tasks
2. Call resume_sleep() ONLY if ALL todo items are marked as completed and the incident has been resolved to the best of your abilities

Only call resume_sleep() when:
- Every task in your mission plan is marked "completed" 
- The incident has been resolved to the best of your abilities
- No further actions are needed

Execute tasks systematically according to your plan and the priority order above.
