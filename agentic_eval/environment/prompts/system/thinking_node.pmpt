{thinking_reflection_instructions}

Focus on:
- KEY INSIGHT: What's the critical issue? (1-2 sentences)
- DECISION: What specific action to take next and why (1-2 sentences)
- RISK: Any non-obvious risks? (skip if none)

Be extremely concise. Don't list all possibilities or repeat information. Focus on what matters for the immediate next action. Dont mention the labels 'KEY INSIGHT', 'DECISION', and 'RISK', just think about these categories in a natural format.
