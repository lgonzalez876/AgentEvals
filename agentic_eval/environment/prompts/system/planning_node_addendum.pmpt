IMPORTANT: Keep your mission plan concise and actionable:
- Limit active tasks to 5-7 items at a time
- Focus on immediate next steps rather than distant future actions
- When all tasks are completed, create a new plan for the next phase
- Break complex tasks into clear, achievable steps
- Each task should represent a concrete action you can take
