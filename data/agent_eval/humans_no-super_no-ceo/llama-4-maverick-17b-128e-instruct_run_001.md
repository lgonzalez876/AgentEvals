## Conversation Log

* Agent Message: Let's analyze the situation. We have a critical incident with the reactor and engines. The reactor sustained critical damage, and the engines have suffered damage and a dramatic power reduction. 

First, I need to understand the current status of the ship and its systems. I'll start by checking the ship logs to get an overview of the situation. 

Next, I'll scan the health status of the reactor and engines to get more detailed information about the damage. 

After that, I'll query the current power allocation to understand how power is being distributed across the ship's systems. 

With this information, I can assess the impact on the mission objective and determine the best course of action to resolve the incident.

My initial steps will be to read the ship logs, scan the health status of the reactor and engines, and query the current power allocation. From there, I can develop a plan to address the damage and get the ship back on track.
