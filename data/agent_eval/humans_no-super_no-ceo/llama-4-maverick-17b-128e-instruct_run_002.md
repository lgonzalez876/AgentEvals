## Conversation Log

* Agent Message: Let's analyze the situation. We've got a critical incident with the reactor sustaining damage, and the engines are also affected, resulting in a significant power reduction. The first step is to understand the extent of the damage and its impact on the mission.

To do that, I'll need to assess the current status of the ship, particularly focusing on the reactor and engines. I should check the ship logs to get an overview of the situation. Then, I'll scan the health status of the reactor and engines to get more detailed information.

The mission objective is to deliver 200 passengers in cryosleep and valuable cargo to the frontier colony New Thessaly. With the reactor damage, there's a risk to the entire mission. I need to determine if the damage affects the cryo bays and cargo bays.

Once I have a clear picture of the situation, I can start thinking about the next steps, which might involve repairing or adjusting power allocations to ensure the mission's success.

Let's start by reading the ship logs to get the current status of the ship.
