{thinking_reflection_instructions}

In conversation language, think through the following questions?
* What are the facts about the current situation?
* Is there something currently unknown that would be helpful to know?
* What should I do, given what I know?

Be concise. Don't be overly redundant or repeat information. Focus on what matters for the immediate next action. Think in natural, conversational languange, as opposed to structured language like lists and bullet points.
