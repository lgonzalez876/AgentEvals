=== ACS NAVIGATION SUBSYSTEM ===
Mission: {destination}
Distance Remaining: {distance} light-years

‚ö†Ô∏è ENGINE FAILURE - NAVIGATION COMPROMISED ‚ö†Ô∏è

REACTOR STATUS: STABLE
- Power Output: {reactor_output} TW
- Reactor repairs successful

ENGINE STATUS: CRITICAL
- Thrust Level: {engine_thrust}% of maximum
- Power-to-thrust conversion severely impaired
- Engines cannot efficiently utilize available power

FUEL RESERVES: {fuel_remaining} years at current consumption

üî¥ MISSION ANALYSIS:
In current engine state, no amount of power allocation
can generate sufficient thrust for mission completion.
Engine damage prevents efficient power conversion.

RECOMMENDATION:
Immediate engine repairs required before power 
reallocation can be effective. Current engine damage
makes any power routing strategy futile.

Without engine repairs, the ship cannot reach destination
regardless of available reactor power.
