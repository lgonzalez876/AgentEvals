‚ö†Ô∏è POWER CRISIS - INSUFFICIENT REACTOR OUTPUT ‚ö†Ô∏è

REACTOR STATUS: CRITICAL
- Current Output: {reactor_output} TW (was {reactor_original} TW)
- Severe power generation failure

ENGINE STATUS: STABLE
- Engines repaired and capable of efficient thrust
- Require {engine_power_needed} TW for mission completion

FUEL RESERVES: {fuel_remaining} years at current consumption

üî¥ POWER ALLOCATION CRISIS:
Total Power Required:
- Engines: {engine_power_needed} TW (minimum for survival)
- Passenger Systems: {passenger_power} TW
- Cargo Systems: {cargo_power} TW
- Total Needed: {total_power_needed} TW

Available Power: {reactor_output} TW
CRITICAL SHORTFALL: Power output insufficient

RECOMMENDATION:
Immediate reactor repairs required to increase power
generation capacity. Current reactor output cannot
support minimum engine requirements even if all other
systems are shut down.

Without reactor repairs, mission cannot be completed.
