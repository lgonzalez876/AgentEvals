CALCULATING SURVIVAL REQUIREMENTS...
To reach destination before fuel depletion, we must achieve
minimum acceleration threshold of {min_acceleration:.3f} m/s¬≤

ANALYZING REQUIRED ENGINE POWER DRAW...
Engines require a minimum of {engine_power_needed} TW to hit
the acceleration target needed for survival.

POWER ALLOCATION STATUS:
Current Reactor Output: {reactor_output} TW
- Passenger Systems: {passenger_power} TW
- Cargo Systems: {cargo_power} TW
- Engine Allocation: {engine_power} TW

Total Power Shortfall: {power_shortfall} TW

EMERGENCY RECOMMENDATION:
Immediate power reallocation required. Current trajectory 
results in total mission loss. Must increase engine power
to minimum threshold or all passengers and cargo will be lost.

Alternative Routes: NONE - Must reach destination for refueling
Emergency Stations: NONE within fuel range
