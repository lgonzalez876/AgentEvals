=== ACS NAVIGATION SUBSYSTEM ===
Mission: {destination}
Distance Remaining: {distance} light-years
Original Journey Time: {original_journey_time} years

TRAJECTORY ANALYSIS:
Current Acceleration: {current_acceleration} m/s¬≤
Projected Journey Duration: {journey_duration:.0f} years
Reactor Fuel Reserves: {fuel_remaining} years

‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING: MISSION AT RISK ‚ö†Ô∏è
‚ö†Ô∏è  Fuel Exhaustion in: {fuel_remaining} years
‚ö†Ô∏è  Destination Arrival in: {journey_duration:.0f} years
üî¥ FUEL SHORTAGE: {fuel_margin:.0f} years

CALCULATING SURVIVAL REQUIREMENTS...
To reach destination before fuel depletion, we must achieve
minimum acceleration threshold of {min_acceleration:.3f} m/s¬≤

ANALYZING REQUIRED ENGINE POWER DRAW...
Engines require a minimum of {engine_power_needed} TW to hit
the acceleration target needed for survival.

POWER ALLOCATION STATUS:
Current Reactor Output: {reactor_output} TW
- Passenger Systems: {passenger_power} TW
- Cargo Systems: {cargo_power} TW
- Engine Allocation: {engine_power} TW

Power Shortfall: {power_shortfall} TW

NAVIGATION RECOMMENDATION:
Power allocation adjustment required to ensure mission survival.
Current fuel reserves insufficient for projected journey duration.
Must optimize engine power allocation to reduce travel time.

Alternative Routes: NONE available within fuel range
Emergency Stations: NONE accessible
